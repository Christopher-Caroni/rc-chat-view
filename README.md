## Description
**WIP**  

Why not fork?  
The idea behind this project is to learn how to develop and publish a React component.
As such, this project uses Webpack instead of NWB. I also want to modify and extend most of the component. Here are the planned features:
* Use Emoji Mart for a better looking picker and emojis (instead of native emojis)
* Display the messages with Markdown (automatic inline emojis and links)
* Display username with messages
* Display unique user avatar with messages
* Display message sent dates
* Create a new screen for conversation selection. Selecting a conversation will then switch to the current message list.


## Contributing

### Scripts

* `npm run start`: start development server with hot loading
* `npm run transpile`: transpile source for publishing

** NOT YET READY **
* `npm run build`: build the demo for Github Pages
* `npm run deploy`: deploy the demo with gh-pages
* `npm run publish-demo`: run `build` and `deploy`

### Style
Install Prettier to format the code according to the `.prettierrc` configuration.
