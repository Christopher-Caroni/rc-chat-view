## Description

**WIP**

Why not fork?  
The idea behind this project is to learn how to develop and publish a React component.
As such, this project uses Webpack instead of NWB. I also want to modify and extend most of the component. Here are the planned features:

-   [x] Use Emoji Mart for a better looking picker and emojis (instead of native emojis)
-   [x] Display the messages with Markdown (automatic inline emojis and links)
-   [x] Display username with messages
-   [x] Display unique user avatar with messages
-   [x] Display message sent dates
-   [ ] Create a new screen for conversation selection. Selecting a conversation will then switch to the current message list.

## Contributing

### Scripts

-   `npm run start`: start development server with hot loading
-   `npm run transpile`: transpile source for publishing

** NOT YET READY **

-   `npm run build`: build the demo for Github Pages
-   `npm run deploy`: deploy the demo with gh-pages
-   `npm run publish-demo`: run `build` and `deploy`

### Style

Install Prettier to format the code according to the `.prettierrc` configuration.
